"iRobot, the company that creates the Roomba robotic vacuum, conducted a survey of the names
their customers gave their robot. Out of the ten most popular, eight of them are human names
such as Rosie, Alfred, Hazel and Ruby. Giving your chatbot a human name seems like a safe
choice since users find them familiar and comfortable. It creates the impression that a
customer is receiving immediate help from a service rep."

Gender:
The smartest bet is to give your chatbot a neutral name devoid of any controversy. Cute or 
clever names such as “Swelly” , a polling chatbot depicted by a whale, and “Woebot” , a 
therapy bot that helps with depression and tracking your mood, show that you can give your 
chatbot a creative non-human-non-robot name that is catchy and to the point.

Alliteration: Try something like Annie the Anthropologie Bot or NikeNick.

Use your branding: Tie your chatbot name in with the branding you already have. 

Be puny, gender neutral.
